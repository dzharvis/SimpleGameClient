This is very simple game using AS3 (Client) + Java (Server). 
Game was designed in such a way, that almost everything is checked on the server.
SKills cooldowns, possibility of rocket hits, speed etc.
I tried to write it in such a way, that it will be possible to increase its complexity and functionality in the future.

The game is very simple now. You just select your nickname and connect to the server. If someone is playing right now, you will see him.
Than you select some player as target and can use some skills to kill him. 

The aim of writing this game wasn't creating of super modern top MMORPG. The aim was to increase my programming expirience. 

There is some bad parts in my game. For example class "Bundle" that is used everyvere in the game - sign of bad architecture (as i know, may be i am wrong).
So if you will find bad solutions of any problem (architecture, algorithms, etc.) please let me know.
